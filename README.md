# RF-Portfolio-Updated

## Description
The portflio site contained in this repository has been created from the skills I've learned thus far within the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp - Fall 2020 cohort.

This site contains 3 pages to include:

- [Index Page](https://github.com/RFlanagan82/RF-Portfolio-Updated/blob/master/index.html)
- [Portfolio](https://github.com/RFlanagan82/RF-Portfolio-Updated/blob/master/portfolio.html)
- [Contact](https://github.com/RFlanagan82/RF-Portfolio-Updated/blob/master/contact.html)

## Usage
All of the files necessary to run this website are available in [this repository](https://github.com/RFlanagan82/RF-Portfolio-Updated).

## Outstanding Issues
A few initial challenges formatting my portfolio images but then I realized that my div containers were redundant in a few places. I reformatted and was able to correct the issue.

Another issue was around adding my picture back into the About page. For some reason it wouldn't accept the path of the picture that was in my assets folder.
